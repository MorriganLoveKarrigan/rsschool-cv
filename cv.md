## About

I started my career a long time ago in the field of marketing and advertising, my friends constantly told me about web development, but I did not attach much importance to this until recently when I first came across how vast and diverse this world is.And I decided to self -study , in the process of self - study I faced a lot of problems , I solved some on my own , I promised to return to some later , but most importantly , I realized that this is the way I would like to go further to become better, develop and learn.I believe that I will definitely be able to become a Frontend Developer

## Code Example

Red Knight is chasing two pawns. Which pawn will be caught, and where?

Input / Output
Input will be two integers:

N / n (Ruby) vertical position of Red Knight (0 or 1).
P / p (Ruby) horizontal position of two pawns (between 2 and 1000000).
Output has to be a tuple (python, haskell, Rust, prolog, C#), an array (javascript, ruby), an object (java), or a structure (C) with:

"Black" or "White" - which pawn was caught
Where it was caught (horizontal position)

```
function redKnight(N, P) {
 let x = 2 * P;
let color = P % 2 == 0 ? N == 0 ? "White" : "Black": N == 0 ? "Black" : "White";
  return [color,x]
}
```
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

```
function createPhoneNumber(numbers){
  return numbers.join('').replace(/(...)(...)(.*)/, '($1) $2-$3');
}
```
